Hello,
- this is a simple source to keep your account online in Discord.
- Please note that this is not a source for bots, it is in the form of a selfbot.

Well, you need to get your token using Discord's development tools and import it into the index.js file.

Now you open the terminal and run this command
```
npm install discord.js
```
 **Note**: that you need Discord.js version 14. 

After the installation is done, you can open the terminal again and run this command 
```
npm i
```
After running the above command, use the following command
```
node .
```
Congratulations your account is online üéâ
